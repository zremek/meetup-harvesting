We host presentations and discussions about Python and Python-related software development (mostly framework-independent).</p>\n<p><span>Currently most talks are held in English language but we usually switch to German if all visitors speak German. Please indicate your interest on the mailing list (</span><a href=\"http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/python-berlin\" class=\"linkified\">http://starship.python.net/cgi-bin/mailman/...</a><span>) if you are interested in any specific language so the speakers can prepare for that. We meet every 2nd Thursday of the month at 7pm at <a href=\"http://co-up.de\">co.up</a>&nbsp;(close to Kottbusser Tor or \"Kotti\" ;-).</span>&nbsp;<span>Since attendance rate in Berlin is usually under 50% only we've stopped limiting the number of RSVPs. As we have space for 40-60 people at </span><a href=\"http://co-up.de\">co.up</a><span> the rule is: first come, first seated.</span></p>\n<p>There is a new <a href=\"http://slack.com\">slack</a> team for us named&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pythonberlin.slack.com\">pythonberlin</a> for which you can invite yourself here:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://pythonberlinslack.herokuapp.com/\">http://pythonberlinslack.herokuapp.com</a><a href=\"https://pythonberlin.eu.ngrok.io\"></a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You might also want to subscribe to our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://starship.python.net/mailman/listinfo/python-berlin\">mailing list</a>&nbsp;(usually in German) which has become rather low-traffic over the last years.</p>\n<p><b>Event organizers, please note:</b> As we receive too many messages asking us to advocate specific events we usually don't do that, except for very special cases with high relevance to the Python community. If you want to advocate your event you're kindly invited to show up at the next meetup in person and give a lightning talk (5 minutes) about it.</p>",

R has an estimated one million users worldwide, and its user base is growing. It is commonly used within academia, in fields like computational biology and applied statistics, and in commercial areas such as quantitative finance and business intelligence.</p>\n<p>Among R's strengths as a language are its powerful built-in tools for inferential statistics, its compact modeling syntax, its data visualization capabilities, and its ease of connectivity with persistent data stores (from databases to flatfiles).</p>\n<p>In addition, R's open source nature and its extensibility via add-on \"packages\" has allowed it to keep up with the leading edge in academic research.</p>\n<p>For all its strengths, though, R has an admittedly steep learning curve; the first steps towards learning and using R can be challenging.</p>\n<p>To this end, the Berlin R Users Group is dedicated to bringing together practitioners of R to exchange knowledge, inspire new users, and spur the adoption of R for innovative research and commercial applications.</p>\n<p>We want to be a diverse and inclusive group.

We also do exercises and proofs together, at first silently everyone alone and then at the whiteboard together. It's all about gaining thorough understanding of the underlying theory to ML: Active participation is highly encouraged, including asking questions that deepen your understanding. There is no homework, but if you join in the middle of a chapter it's advisable that you get familar with the previous pages. <br></p>\n<p>Although we are in the middle of a book, you can join at any time, as the chapters are very independent. The only requirement to succesfully do this is that you have a background in machine learning theory. A common way to achieve this is to having attended a course on Machine Learning. <br></p>",

        "description": "<p>Intelligent/Cognitive Systems consume data that are too complex for current databases to handle. GRAKN.AI is a hyper-relational database that allows you to perform knowledge engineering to manage this complexity. Effectively, Grakn provides a Knowledge Base (aka. Knowledge Graph) as the core foundation of intelligent systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Grakn provides an intelligent query language, Graql: Grakn’s reasoning (through OLTP) and analytics (through OLAP) query language, which is a much higher-level abstraction over traditional query languages. This allows intelligent systems to benefit from an intuitive language the provides&nbsp;an expressive schema for knowledge modelling, reasoning transactions for real-time inference, distributed algorithms for large-scale analytics, and optimisation of query execution. Grakn also provides the logical integrity of SQL, the scale of relationships of Graph databases, and the horizontal scalability of NoSQL. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this community, we discuss the underlying technology and applications of the Grakn hyper-relational database. We will also discuss the techniques of a new software engineering principle, Knowledge-Driven Development, that Grakn now enables. The group is for engineers to demonstrate their solutions and share the lessons they learnt, as well as business leaders to learn applications of Grakn in their business.</p>",

        "description": "<p>This meetup, which started back in April 2015, grew out of the community of weird scientists and hackers that got to know each other through the annual hackathon <a href=\"http://berlin.sciencehackday.org/\">Science Hack Day Berlin</a>. Wanting to hack science all the time rather than just once a year, we launched a couple of monthly science hacking meetups to get together, get inspired, hack things, get help, have some Spaß, and keep this awesome science ball a-rolling. <br></p>\n<p> <b>Why science hacking?</b> <br>We can't put it better than Ariel Waldmann, co-founder of <a href=\"http://sciencehackday.org/\">Science Hack Day</a>: “There has been a considerable movement in the last few years to make science more open between scientific disciplines and to the perceived “public”. But simply making science open – by placing datasets, research, and materials online and using open source licensing – is only half the battle. Open is not the same as accessible. Often the materials are very cryptic or are buried deep within a government website where they’re not easy to find.” - we want to help make that material and those ideas more accessible by bringing scientists out of the ivory tower and into the 'real world' ;). We want to help break down barriers to non-specialist involvement in science. <br></p>\n<p><b>What is science hacking?</b> <br>A hack is a quick solution to a problem – maybe not the most elegant solution, but often the cleverest. Hacking is about using imagination and creativity to reinvent and reclaim the world - for good, for serious, or just for fun. Science Hacking is where we take all this awesome hacking jazz and use it for science. Take a community of science geeks, coders, designers, makers, inventors, and enthusiasts, mix them together in a big melting pot of different perspectives and approaches, add a bunch of tools and materials, and see what comes out: awesome ideas, the next great start-up, real hard science, or the weirdest, most useless things you could never imagine.</p>\n<p>Some of our favourite science hack examples: <br>_ <a href=\"http://ariel.soup.io/post/90842565/Near-Earth-Object-Lamp\">a desk lamp that lights up every time an asteroid flies by the Earth</a> <br>_ <a href=\"http://sciencehackday.org/project/particle-windchime/\">an augmented super collider diagnostic tool that let’s you listen to the sounds of particle collisions</a> <br>_ <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/pWhtfg\">from SHDB2014, a project to simulate radioactive decay using popping popcorn</a> <br>_ <a href=\"https://flic.kr/p/pWhtfg\">Also from SHDB2014, \"Feel the planet\" - using seismic data to control the vibrations of a dildo (and other things)</a>&nbsp;</p>",

        "description": "<p>Let's meet every other week or so to work on ML problems and get really good fast! Machine Learning involves many disciplines (<i>Calculus, Probability, Linear Algebra, Coding, Mining, Deployment, Data Vis</i>) and some of them lend themselves well for group study. It's not about discussing AI papers.</p>\n<p>Although I love the beauty of mathematical proofs and their intricacies... I want to focus on cementing insights with code.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>That means working with data and getting results (predicitve models). The goal here is to become solid at doing and eventually deploying. (pair-coding and peer-testing might be a good option let's see)</span> <br></p>\n<p>If you're game you should have at least completed 1+ ML course, implemented some algorithms or have experience with one of the disciplines above so you can contribute to the group. (~~ beginner/intermediate skill level)</p>\n<p>We will use Python.</p>\n<p>Hope to see you soon, <br>Markus</p>\n<p><b>Good Resources –&nbsp;</b>all you need is Jeremy Howard (and Love)<b>:</b></p>\n<p>Fast.ai (ML for coders) is by <b>orders of magnitude</b>!! better and more up to date than anything else.

Auf den Data Science MeetUps treffen sich Fach- und Führungskräfte im Bereich Data Science sowie angrenzende Bereiche, wie etwa Datenbankmanagement, Business Intelligence oder Data Warehousing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Die Teilnahme ist kostenlos!</p>\n<p><b>Wozu Data Science MeetUps?</b></p>\n<p>Die Data Science Szene ist sehr vielfältig. Während die Einen vor allem auf proprietäre Software setzen, bevorzugen die Anderen vor allem Open Source Lösungen.&nbsp;<span>Viele MeetUps beschränken sich auf ganz bestimmte Tools oder Methoden aus dem Data Science oder bleiben regionale, wir hingegen bieten über generelle Data Science MeetUps die Möglichkeit übergreifend zwischen Data Scientists netzwerken zu können - und das mehreren Städten in Deutschland!</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Wo finden MeetUps statt?</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Wir beginnen mit regelmäßigen Data Science MeetUps in Berlin und München, werden jedoch demnächst auch eines in Frankfurt am Main starten.</span></p>\n<p><span><b>Was wird bei einem MeetUp gemacht?</b></span></p>\n<p><span>Unsere MeetUps sind absolut zwanglos, denn es geht vor allem ums Netzwerken in der Szene und um das Austauschen von Projekterfahrung und Wissen über Data Science Methodik.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Einige MeetUps beginnen mit ein bis zwei Präsentationen von engagierten Mitgliedern, in jedem Fall gibt es danach reichlich Zeit fürs gegenseitige Kennenlernen und Austauschen.</span></p>\n<p><span>Data Scientists auf Jobsuche vermitteln wir zudem sehr gerne an potenzielle Auftraggeber und Arbeitgeber. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Wer sollte dieser Gruppe beitreten?</b></p>\n<p>Waschechte Data Scientists und solche, die es werden wollen. Aber auch artverwandte Fachbereiche (beispielsweise Datenbank-Entwickler und NoSQL-Architekten, aber auch Hacker) sind herzlichst eingeladen.</p>\n<p>Ferner sind Recruiter und Journalisten/Redakteure, die Kontakt in die Szene suchen, willkommen - Bitte sprechen Sie den Organisator an!</p>",

It is not always easy to describe what “managing data” means, but we think, that we can agree, that in our daily life, we control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data and information assets. <br>To do this successfully, we are constantly expanding our knowledge due to the fast technological progress and we need to be open minded for new topics. But as you also know, in our day-to-day business, it is not always easy to catch up with all the different DM-related content as we also need to stay focused to complete our regular tasks primarily.</p>\n<p>Please find here our DM Meet &amp; Mingle group. We want to create an opportunity for all those, who are interested to dive into DM topics cross-functionally in a relaxed and open atmosphere. It is intended to be highly interactive and you are the ones who determine the topics.<br></p>\n<p>We decided that we will keep this as an open and private meeting, therefore please distribute this invite to colleagues (independent of company affiliation), friends and anyone interested in data and wants to get in contact with other interesting Data Managers (in a broader sense) from different areas, listening to their stories by nice drinks and food. If you have topics, that you would like to discuss during these meetings, just let us know. As well if you know someone from another department/company/etc. who wants to share and exchange his/her experiences. </p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>Cheers &amp; looking forward to see you </p>\n<p>Hi-Gung</p>\n<p> <br></p>\n<p>P.S.: Just to give you an idea of possible topics: <br>Big data vs. small data from dark data, Data Warehousing, Data Mining, Data Management in other industries, Data in the cloud, Data security, Data Standards, etc…</p>",

Yet high-quality online survey research still depends on large sample sizes, lengthy fieldwork and complicated setups - costing industry players lots of time and money.</p> \n<p>In an effort to ensure high quality insights whilst maintaining a cost-effective and agile approach to survey research, both Dalia and Predict Wise have embraced MRP (Multilevel Regression and Poststratification). </p> \n<p>Join us as Predict Wise’s Founder &amp; Chief Science Officer, Tobias Konitzer, discusses how MRP is used in production. He will focus on how Predict Wise mixes ambient data with structured survey data to drive first-class estimation, and finish with how they develop products mapping all 250,000,000 Americans on 200+ attitudes. </p> \n<p>Agenda:</p> \n<p>18:00 - 18:30 Networking: welcome drinks and snacks</p> \n<p>18:30 - 19:30 Speaker: Tobias Konitzer, Phd</p> \n<p>19:30 - 20:00 Q &amp; A</p> \n<p>20:00 - 21:00 Networking</p> \n<p>How to find us:</p> \n<p>Dalia Research, Lobeckstraße 30/35 Entrance H, 2nd floor, 10969 Berlin</p>",
